PRIVATE KEY READ ME:

If you're trying to SSH into the created EC2 instance with the private key that I\'92ve included here.

1. Let's move the SSH keys from the SimpliSafeHW Folder (Directory), into the /.ssh/ Folder (Directory) 
2. Once that\'92s done, open Terminal
3. Type in this command:
4. chmod 400 ~/.ssh/sskey
The command then grants you permissions to use the private key as it\'92s your own, thanks!
